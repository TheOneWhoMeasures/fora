Another sunrise when the cold simmers down the ashes of clouds,
Vivid shapes darkening from the white stripes are sparse,
Every mist's a winter-like challenge along the burdens of the day
Right at the dawn, we speak, we cherish, and display
In many different ways, like I'd say "to be with you's a joy"
Ending the night with words truly meant, without a coy.

Mistaken lips, a drink and it slipped, then regretted but
I'm delighted though not wanting to lose how it all started so
Have a read again, then consider to know more of each other
As even the most colorful butterfly waits for the coneflowers
In order to sprout, to grow, to bloom then they can hover.

Thus the burden of time is the moment, as without patience
Yields only stalks with a withering cadence.
