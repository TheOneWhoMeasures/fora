The moss-crept stonewall shot towards the skies, giving sight only to the piercing rooftops of the castle and the eagles hovering and nesting above it, while a shining gate with barbs on the edges rivalled its heights.

And Sanyu's eyes are stuck on to it: to the footholds, the railings, and the holes that one could clamp a hand on.

"So what's the plan?" His friend had to ask.

"There's none," Sanyu said through his teeth.

Marlow exhaled then planted a hand on to his face.

--

A man draped in a charred-like cloak dropped on to his knees and before him is the Queen poised on her throne.

"Your highness, its with great regret that I inform you, that his whereabouts were unknown since yesterday"

The Queen placed a nail below her chin and crossed her legs.

"And how is that possible?" She asked. The kneeling man began swallowing a lump on his neck.

"H-he seems to posses a trail of intervening energy that completely deem ours ineffective-" 

"Do you suppose to tell me that the skilled trackers of Yelirn is 'ineffective' to some random man with a curse?"

The man ransacked his mind for an answer but ended up frozen on his pose.

"Do i have to request the aid of the great sages just to deal with this one tiny nuisance while the more important matters of the kingdom are at stake!"

"Th-that is what I do not understand, your highness, if I may... why not just impose a bounty on him and let him be"

The Queen stood up, stretched a hand for the nearest blade, held it up before her face and let her own image shine through its reflection.

"Fool, I am not just a Queen of this country. In regards to everything in this world that matters, I am also a mother... And for her sake, she cannot be hurt by affection, and you cannot remove affection, without removing his presence"

--

On a steep corner, crowded by a large shadow, two figures are hanged on to a stonewall with only their fingers and nails holstered on to edges and holes through unrefined gravel.

"To go through all this trouble, if you want a royalty that you have a chance on... why don't you just pick a court lady instead?" Mallow asked, his limping arm scanning the walls for a bump or a tear.

"How immature... if you want a more boring friend why don't you just get a pig instead" Sanyu replied climbing faster than his friend.

"a pig? you're over exaggerating" 

"I am not, don't insult my princess" Sanyu said, his words were sharp and Marlow ended up wishing he could shrug.

When they reached the top of the stonewall, the blazing sun greeted them, and looking below them; the grounds are farther into a great distance such that their bones will crumble to hundreds of pieces if they were to fall.

"How are we supposed to get down from here?" Marlow asked.

"You see the window over there?" Sanyu pointed to a tower's open window, just below them but still a distance away.

Marlow nodded.

"With enough momentum, I'm sure I can jump and land exactly inside of it" Sanyu wiggled his hand to demonstrate.

Marlow's eyes widened and his face went blank.

"Uhh.. no, i won't do that" He replied.

"Don't worry only I need to do it, I'll find you a rope or a staircase once I'm inside"

Marlow palmed his face again and sighed.

"No... jumping over there is ridiculous and you will di-"

As he was protesting, Sanyu had already leapt on to the air.

--

"Sister Eve, may i come in?" A young freckled woman asked through a door.

Then Eve returned to reality with the mention of her name. Since the silver crown had been numb on her grasps, she had to let it sit back on top of her head before striding to turn the doorhandle.

"If it isn't May, my sister... Did you come for a reading session?" Eve asked, her reddened palms reached for May's wrists.

May nodded and displayed a collection of books before her sister.

"Wreath-making and design, you chose this?" Eve asked.

May nodded again.

"Great! I also like this, it will be better to do it with more people don't you think? Shall we head over to meet the girls?"

As they stood up to make their way out of the room, the Queen appeared through the door with a gentle smile.

"Heading out to play?" she asked.

"Yes mom, to the court ladies" May replied.

"You were already that close to each other?" The Queen turned to Eve.

"Not at all, but perhaps this time I could befriend them through this" Eve replied, showing the illustration of a flower beaded on to a circle at its cover page.

"Well then, have fun" the Queen replied watching the two leave through the door.

The Queen sat on to the bedside with a grin.

--

Sanyu's feet came paddling on to the air and Marlow's screaming was muffled by the wind.

He was thrown towards the tower, zooming across, watching the open window and praying that he will get through it.

He passed through the window but as he's still carried by excess momentum he slapped his hand on the floor, and it allowed his shoulders to fall and roll his body over.

Sharp pain entered through his back and forearm, but he gritted his teeth and pulled himself up.

The interior of the castle was made mostly of marble casting of floor, pearl-like statues, and plentiful torches.

"Why's it so quiet" Sanyu asked himself as he pick himself up.

He began with light steps and shagging his back to every walls like a thief, then peering over to see the corridors by craning his neck.

There is one isolated door with brass handles and the insignia of a butterfly.

"Eve!" Sanyu yelped and ran across to open the door.

With one twist, the lock unclicked and the door swung open.

"Sanyu The Cursed, you have overstepped your bounds" There appeared the Queen, with a smile of a snake who had caught a pray on her nest.

And while Sanyu felt something creep up his back.

It was the sharp edges of a lance held by a stern faced soldier.

* Author's Note *
This chapter... is a bit too plot-based than my experience with you, i just wanted to get through this one then after that its going to mirror our real story again (Still, i would jump a tower if i can see you)
[or i might rewrite this since even the prose is crap]

-- On the more important note, here's my actual message --

I woke up thinking that nothing has changed from my days like the last three of them. Those are nights where I think of you and things that I shouldn't be thinking of, days of pointless distraction and not getting anything done. I was needfully worried of/for you and I will always be even if you tell me not to.

Anyways, that is until I began checking if you had sent me any messages through the website.

When I saw that there is an inbound message, and that it came from "Eve" herself.

I don't know what to tell you but since reading through what you've written, I was overjoyed. You claiming the name I've crowned you with just made me smile. And best of all, i got to listen to you again.

And about Z, I've actually known that its not because of him why you blocked me in the first place. Especially after we talked, I think I might've just said that at the time to avoid my responsibilities of thinking about the fact that you may not return anymore because of me. And yes its because of me.

With that said, he was understandably dejected after knowing the truth. I also feel responsible for this and decided that I would befriend the guy, it wasn't difficult as he was really nice like you said. So far we were able to share our piece of mind to each other. And that there are a lot for me to learn about him and through my own will I wanted to become another pillar of support till he also picks himself back up. Hopefully I can help you with this problem this time... Even so, I don't feel like giving you up to him haha. He has told me to make you forget about him completely if possible, and if we become a thing then I'll make sure that happens.

Anyways, Reven and Luiza wanted to tell you something but they still hadn't finished writing their messages so I'm just putting it on the next "chapters" to come.

Lastly, i know that this tiny world i have created for you won't replace the one that you had. If you will hold on to this, i want you to think of this as my hand and that you're at arms with something that will try its best to keep pulling you along, on one merry journey even if you begin to fall out of love of me. If you think we are meant for each other, then we may just really be. Just so you know, from this point onwards we must do our best for ourselves so one day when we're matured enough we'll be able to admit that we're also doing it for our love. Cheesy as that may be.

My dreams, you should become a part of it.
