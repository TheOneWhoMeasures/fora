The crown glistened on top of Eve's fingers, her eyes emptying at each moment she explores the sparkles of it.

It had just been that her ears were ringing from the sudden bolting of the door, right before her mother, the Queen disappeared from view.

The crown and its embroidered butterfly insignia should've settled her emotions to a smothering calm, but that day it was replaced by a rush of memories that only weighed on her.

"You can't see him anymore, Eve" The Queen had said to her.

"Sanyu, you should've been used to it by now..." Marlow said through an emptied wine bottle, his moustache edging on its opening.

"I know" Sanyu replied, snatching the bottle from Marlow's hands, peering inside of it before tossing it off to one side.

The bottle flipped across the floor, slipping through a mountain of other empty bottles, some having been cracked on their faces, and rolling about.

"Then what's with the mug, old pal?" Marlow asked, his eyes struggling to keep itself open.

"I'm used to the curse Marlow, not the goddamn consequences of it!" Sanyu said, slamming his fist on the table.

"Take it easy, take it easy...I got you, you mean you jush got ta.. try... and.." 

Marlow's shoulders dropped at the table, head resting on one side before snoring out loud.

Sanyu stood up, shook his head and covered his friend's frail body with his cloak.

"Old pal, you're the one who doesn't change..." He gave Marlow a light tap before sauntering out of the wooden hut.

Sanyu resigned himself to walking across the nearby riverbank, one with a hand of sparkling water expanding across the horizon, and there's only the bed of grass and smooth stone separating the blue from the gray and the green.

He slouched on a tree trunk.

There on the grass in front of him used to have a flawless lady who mesmerized the flowers and the butterflies that surrounded her.

"And you are?" Sanyu remembered the time she asked her name.

"Eve"

That was the first beginning of their daily meeting at the same bed of grass, to talk, and to smile, and each passing day Sanyu realizes that he too, like the butterflies and the dandelions was also becoming mesmerized of her.

But his heart's fluttering would be halted, and the words that he had an iron fist grip on became an inquiry.

"I'm starting to fall for you? Is it possible to fall for anyone? For someone like me who's fated to lose everyone"

"Do you mean I'm not good enough?"

"It's not that, its just I'm... haven't you heard of me? Don't you know who I am?" He tore through the tall grasses his hands could find until she stops it with her fingers, lining her nails on to his palms.

"Has that ever mattered between us?" She whispered, her face was a lip away from his.

And the sun fell from the skies that day with only the chirping of the birds and gush of water, no talking, no laughing.

Sanyu woke up, his hands buried on his face before tracing his own lips.

"How sweet" he repeated.

He sat up and stretched his limbs, the soreness and sturdiness drifting away from his tendons.

"Good mornin-" Sanyu stopped after realising a parchment was laid on his table. Its stainless white glowed among the dust painted table, suited to the broken shack of his.

"A Letter From The Majesty, why would this be here?" he reads the header.

"Sanyu The Cursed, the Queen warns that you obey the judicial order: To not come near the Princess, not a nickel nor an acre away"

"Eve... a princess?" He crushed the parchment on his hands.
